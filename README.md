# Best Movies
> The purpose of this project is to get familiar with cloud computing infrastructure and the strategic considerations for using cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure surrounds a social platform for movie enthusiasts, capable of displaying movie related data collected from public APIâ€™s. 

> The development process began with creating a physical architecture of the system. The application is a Docker containerized REST API service hosted both on Google Cloud and Vercel that uses Firebase SDK as a storage container.

> The system is built using a Node.js, full-stack Next.js framework and can register new users, displaying an initial list of movies, displaying movies from random categories, filter movies and actors and create a list of watched movies.
> Live demo [Google cloud](https://movies-google-run-2z2522fkva-lz.a.run.app). 
> Live demo [Vercel](https://best-movies-js.vercel.app/).
